# Thermostat
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.  
The Raspberry Pi project focused on developing smart thermostat that utilized LEDs and an LED display to demonstrate real-time input using sensors and user response, and output control. The goal was to solve the problem of managing and displaying system states efficiently using GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. By simulating a real-world control system, the project emphasized how software can manage hardware components seamlessly in an emerging systems architecture environment.

What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well in building and testing the circuit on a solderless breadboard. My code logic for handling LED display updates and GPIO control was clean, efficient, and easy to follow. I also demonstrated a strong understanding of how to synchronize software and hardware processes.

Where could you improve?
The main area for improvement is my state diagram, which represents how the system functions. While the logic in my implementation was correct, the diagram could be clearer and more detailed in illustrating state transitions and the overall flow of the systemâ€™s logic.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of how a Raspberry Pi functions and how to interface with GPIO pins, adding valuable knowledge and practical skills to my support network.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project strengthened several skills that are highly transferable to future coursework and professional projects, including hardware-software integration and an understanding of embedded systems, system design thinking whcih is useful for larger-scale architectures and IoT systems, and debugging and problem-solving in real-time environments.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the project maintainable and adaptable by, writing segmented code, with functions dedicated to distinct system tasks, and including clear comments and consistent naming conventions.


# Module 1
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project demonstrates how to use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) on a Raspberry Pi to fade an LED in and out. The main problem it addresses is learning to control the brightness of a light through software which introduces fundamental concepts of hardware-software integration and embedded systems programming.

What did you do particularly well?
I successfully implemented PWM to control the LED brightness and created clean, structured code that loops through increasing and decreasing duty cycles. I ensured the system responds correctly to a keyboard interrupt which allowed the program to exit cleanly and safely reset the GPIO pins.

Where could you improve?
An area for growth is enhancing my ability to consistently meet project deadlines. While this project demonstrates effective PWM control and proper GPIO management, I aim to strengthen my time management and project planning skills to ensure timely completion of future milestones without compromising quality.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Through this project, I gained deeper familiarity with the Raspberry Pi GPIO library. I was also able to get hands-on experience with Python programming for embedded systems.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project strengthened my skills in hardware-software integration and understanding of embedded systems. It provided me with the chance to implement system design thinking, and debugging in real-time environments which gives me a chance to exercise my abilities for furture application in my career.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code was written with modular loops for PWM control, and clear comments explaining each step. This makes it readable for others, and easy to maintain in future continuation for this project.
